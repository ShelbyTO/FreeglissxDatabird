Context

Olist now aims to expand its offerings in the sports segment by encouraging sports equipment marketplaces to join the platform. To refine its strategy for these sellers, Olist needs to analyze their offerings and positioning to better understand the market in which they operate.

In particular, Olist's Sales team is interested in FreeGlisse, an online marketplace for second-hand ski equipment. Their goal is to gather as much information as possible from what FreeGlisse displays on its website.

Instructions

Olist wants to initially focus on the skis segment. The information to be studied includes: the number of ski listings, the prices offered, the distribution of the offer among different subcategories, possibly the depth of stock (i.e., the number of available products or the number of sizes available per product), and anything else that might be interesting for analyzing FreeGlisse's market positioning.

This information would be particularly valuable if studied by type of ski (as indicated in the Technical Sheet of each ski). Feel free to make relevant groupings, conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses using pandas, and create beautiful graphs. For the graphs, you will use Google Data Studio.

On the technical side, two skills will be utilized: crawling between the different pages of the site to observe all second-hand ski offers (here, no need for selenium - simpler techniques will suffice), and scraping individual pages to extract various pieces of information.

Finally, the objective of this case is also to derive business insights from these analyses, particularly conclusions about FreeGlisse's commercial positioning and the unique characteristics it could bring to Olist.
